# Unit-converter

A unit converter between the metric and imperial measurement systems. 
The user may choose a value either by mouse or typing, then clicking on "conversion" will give the different conversion values between the two systems in length (meters ⇄ feet), in volume (liters ⇄ gallons), in mass (kilograms ⇄ pounds) and in temperature (Celsius ⇄ Fahrenheit).

It is a very basic webapp I made when I was learning code by myself. Done only in html css and vanilla js.
